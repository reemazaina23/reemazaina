        <div id="about_me" class="about_me">
            <p>I started at the end of my high school I heard about the specialty of my friends and started reading and
            looking for and open the YouTube videos I know more and never learn myself from the net and books. I was encouraged by
            the fact that this specialization is very much needed in the labor market and this attracted me to his part and to
            contain a large proportion of logic and informed me how to deal with problems and solve them in different ways I can
            think from the way I was before I was very interested in computer
            I chose it because I felt that I was building a field for a large area and I woke myself up to know the increase and
            deepen it by picking it up and loving it, and I feel that I am creative in it
            I read about the field a lot and about people who were programmers started from scratch and became inspired by a great
            footprint in programming such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and hoped that one day I would be like them</p>
