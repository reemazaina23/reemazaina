        <div id="about_me" class="about_me">
            <p>I am Rima Abu Zeina I am 19 years old. I study IT in the Islamic University
                My beginnings in this field were after the end of my high school studies. I heard about it from my friends and then I started to know more about this field through books and videos. What encouraged me more is the continuous demand for this field in the labor market and not only in the local labor market.
                He attracted me more because he made me think about problems in a logical way and find a solution
                For as long as I am fond of computers to learn more and gain knowledge
                I chose this field because I feel that I belong to this community and found myself seeking for more knowledge about it.
                I started reading about the success stories of people who started in this field from Zero and then got a big name
                I hope to become like them one day</p>
